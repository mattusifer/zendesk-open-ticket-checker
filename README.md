# zendesk-open-ticket-checker

A program I wrote to check for open Zendesk tickets that need a response via the Zendesk Core API. These are defined as open tickets that are assigned to the provided email where the last response is from a different user.

I have it set up to run every 30 minutes and add those tickets to my TODO list in org mode.
